The summer after my freshman year of college, I started an Etsy store. I make stuffed animals modeled after "Totoro", a character from the Miyazaki movie "My Neighbor Totoro". Sewing had always been a hobby of mine and I decided to turn it into a small business. I optimized my design such that I could produce each Totoro for under $3 within 2 hours apiece. I created an Etsy store front for my Totoro's and have fulfilled orders as far as the UK and Finland.
