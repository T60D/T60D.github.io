As a personal project, I made a stroboscope. It features 24 images on a spinning disc with strobe lights that flash every 1/24th of a second. This makes it appear as though the images are animated. I designed the entire device myself and built it over the course of 2 weeks. It serves as a scientific demonstration of how film works and the mind can be tricked into perceiving multiple images as movement.

The stroboscope is controlled by an Arduino that drives a stepper motor to rotate at a speed of one rotation per second. It also makes the LED lights under each picture light up for a few milliseconds at a rate of 24 times/second. The body of the design consists of MDF and 3D printed parts.
