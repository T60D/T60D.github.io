ME 350 is a mechatronics class every mechanical engineering student takes at UMich. In this class, students work in teams of 5 to build a four bar linkage. This linkage catches marbles that drop from the top, reads the color, and sorts them. I was the project lead, so I led design and manufacturing of our linkage. We designed the system in SolidWorks, conducted analysis in Adams, made it using a waterjet, mills, and lathes, and programmed the Arduino PID controller.
