Iron Man is an innovation on the design of the average clothes iron. It can be folded, making it more portable as well as giving it a more modern appearance. I created the Iron man prototype at the University of Michigan 2018 Makeathon with an industrial design student and another mechanical engineer. I made the internal circuitry and helped manufacture the outside housing. Our project came in first place, winning us over $1000.
