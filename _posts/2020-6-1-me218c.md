ME218A is a Stanford class where you learn about communication protocols and how to implement them on a microcontroller. This included writing assembly code on a PIC microcontroller to communicate with a computer over UART, and developing an audio tone based communication protocol to communicate with other students over the internet.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this class was required to be taught in a virtual format. As such, our final project was to develop an audio tone based communication protocol, where frequencies/timing of a tone would translate to bits, and implement this onto a PIC microcontroller. Each microcontroller would then send audio over a voice channel to play a programmed game against other students. This project included the following features:
* Servo motor to actuate a push-to-talk button on a keyboard
* Student developed communication protocol that dictate the timing of when transmissions would be sent to ensure different teams were not "talking over each other"
* Frequency decoder on the PIC microcontroller that used the built in analog to digital converter to read in data from a microphone and then calculated the frequency from this data
* Tone generator that uses the digital to analog converter on the PIC to generate a sin wave at varying frequencies to send to a speaker

Hardware setup for the project

The most valuable aspect of this project was that we had to develop our own communication protocol, rather than implementing someone elses. With this, we learned a lot about what makes communication protocols effective. The two major deficits we found in ours through testing was that it was too slow, it would take 2 seconds to transmit a message, and that it had no way to acknowledge if the message heard was correctly heard. Sending audio messages over voice apps, especially with poor WiFi, had frequent errors and many messages would be lost in transit.

Code excerpt that decoded the frequency of received audio tones; the ADC reads analog signals from a microphone into a 200 element array at a rate of 16.67 kHz
