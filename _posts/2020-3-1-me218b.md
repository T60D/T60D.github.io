ME218A is a Stanford class where you learn and apply complicated mechatronics. We learn about practical circuit design including motor drivers, microcontroller timers, and interrupts.

During this class, we conducted many labs and one final project. The topics of the labs are as follow:
* Drive a stepper motor
* Drive a DC motor with an encoder for speed control
* Create a basic robot that can identify and move towards a beacon emitting pulsed IR light


For the final project in the class, we had to create a robot that would autonomously compete in a game against robots made by the other students. We had to create a robot that would find "beacons" on a board and move them to our zone. Our robot, dubbed "Bobbithy", has the following features.
* Two DC motors/encoders to drive the robot at controllable speeds
* Custom designed laser cut frame
* Two sets of IR detectors (front and back) to find beacons emitting a pulsed IR light source
* Electromagnet that can grab and move the beacons
* Color sensor to detect what area of the board the robot is in
* Accelerometer to detect what direction the robot is facing, since the board is tilted by 3 degrees
* A bumper with limit switches to detect contact
* Beam break sensors to detect when the robot is holding the beacon

This was a very difficult project due to the tremendous amount of features that needed to be implemented and that the robot had to function during the game with no human intervention. Our robot also had a nickname, "Mister steal yo miner", since our robot was the only one that had the ability to steal beacons from the other teams (also known as Miners), while still being able to move our own beacons. This project was an incredibly rewarding experience and is where I learned the most of my mechatronics knowledge.

One circuit used in the project to read IR light coming from the beacons into the microcontroller as digital pulses.
