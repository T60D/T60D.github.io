When wear a pair of jeans or a sweater once, it is now too dirty to put back in your wardrobe but simultaneously too clean to wash. Most millennials leave these clothes on the floor or have a "chairdrobe" for it. At the 2019 University of Michigan Makeathon, I worked with an industrial designer and mechanical engineering to make "Limbo" which serves as a home for these clothes. Additionally, it uses UV light to disinfect your clothes. We placed in 2nd in the open design portion of the competition winning $500.
