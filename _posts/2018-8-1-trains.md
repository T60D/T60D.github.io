### Tangent Scale Models

Tangent is a hobby company that makes 1:87.1 model train cars for hobbyists and train enthusiasts. The cars Tangent makes are among the most accurate and detailed in the world. I designed five 1950's era model train box cars using reference pictures and the original engineering drawings. What made this job difficult was that these pictures were very low resolution and the drawingWs, since they were 50 years old, were in poor shape and missing dimensions. Through Tangent, I learned how to work around incomplete information.
