ENGR 100 is a technical communication class all freshman engineering students take at UMich. In this class, students work in teams to build an underwater ROV to enter in a competition, write a report on, and present the ROV. My team created an innovative design by having modular components so the ROV could be configured separately for the speed and maneuverability competition. Thanks to this, we were able to make an ROV that was the second fastest as well as the most maneuverable, making it the strongest overall.  
The next year, I served as a peer mentor for the class to help another group of freshman through the project. I was dedicated to the role and went above and beyond what was expected of me to teach my students how to make an ROV. The faculty for the class recognized me efforts and awarded me the "Outstanding Peer Mentor" award out of the 12 peer mentors in the class.
