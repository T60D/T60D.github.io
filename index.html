					My background
				</h2>
				<p class="editable">
					Born in West Windsor New Jersey, I developed a passion for mechanical engineering from my hobby of modifying Nerf guns. Then, I moved onto a bachelors in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering at the University of Michigan. There, I worked on a student race car team and started making my first inventions. Now, I am pursuing my masters in mechanical engineering at Stanford where I am learning how to design better products.
