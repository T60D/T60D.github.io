							<h4>Hello</h4>
							<p>My name is David! I am an incoming masters student at Stanford in mechanical engineering. I completed my bachelors at the University of Michigan where I majored in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering. I have a strong interest in mechanical and electrical design for consumer products.</p>

						<p>I was born on March 3rd in central New Jersey (yes it's real) and lived there my entire life. I became interested in engineering at a young age thanks to my parents who were MIT grads and worked in transportation. I eventually chose mechanical engineering and my current university due to my hobby of modifying Nerf guns. During high school, I would take Nerf guns apart and replace key components such as the springs and barrel to improve performance. I eventually moved onto making my own Nerf guns from PVC pipe and polycarbonate tubing using designs I found online. This hobby made me interested in designing and manufacturing mechanical systems and is why I am studying mechanical engineering.</br><br/>

						While I don't spend as much time playing with toy guns as I used to, I found many other projects to work on in college. I spent 3.5 years on the Michigan Hybrid racing team where I designed and TIG welded our chassis and led our largest division. I also started a startup called "Thettle" where I built prototypes and competed in pitch competitions. Additionally, I manage an Etsy store where I sell stuffed animals I make and am a member of multiple engineering honors organizations. I was also involved in biomedical manufacturing research where I built the worlds best phantoms for mimicking the insertion of micro electrodes into a rat brain.<br/><br/>

						The thing about me is that I am never the type of person who focuses purely on one thing. I like to jump on many different projects and always seek to expand my skill set. If you take a look through the rest of this website, you will see that I have been involved in a wide variety of projects ranging from rat brains to all-terrain wheelchairs.<br><br>
