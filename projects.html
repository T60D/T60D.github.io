						<h4>Limbo</h4>
						<p>When wear a pair of jeans or a sweater once, it is now too dirty to put back in your wardrobe but simultaneously too clean to wash. Most millennials leave these clothes on the floor or have a "chairdrobe" for it. At the 2019 University of Michigan Makeathon, I worked with an industrial designer and mechanical engineering to make "Limbo" which serves as a home for these clothes. Additionally, it uses UV light to disinfect your clothes. We placed in 2nd in the open design portion of the competition winning $500.</p>

						<h4>All-Terrain Wheelchair</h4>
						<p>For my mechanical engineering senior design project, I worked on a team of 7 people to build an all-terrain wheelchair. We started this project from scratch and worked on it for one semester with the goal of creating a wheelchair a local resident could use in sand and forest terrains. I was in charge of all electrical systems and welding of all mechanical components. After one semester, we successfully created a working wheelchair that could be used in the sand.</p>

					 				<p>My primary role on the team was the high voltage accumulator and low voltage controls system lead. I had the most experience with electrical systems and designed an electrical system capable of powering and controlling four 800W electric motors for our powertrain. The biggest challenges with building my design was time and budget. I only had one semester to complete this project and a shoestring budget, but I successfully built a working electrical system within the time constraint for only $382.</p>

					 				<p>The high voltage accumulator consists of 2 parallel sets of 16 series LiFePO4 3.2V cells (16s2p) to create a 48V 40AH battery. The batteries came as a donation but the supporting battery management systems, plastic insulating box, and charger were purchased. I had very little experience with working with batteries before this project and learned a lot about how to wire them properly.</p>

					 				<p>The main controller is an Arduino Mega which sends PWM signals (converted to analog via a low pass filter) to e-bike motor controllers. These motor controllers than control the speed of each brushless DC motor in each wheel. NPN transistors controlled by the Arduino simulate physical switches across the motor controller to switch the motor direction. An Arduino Mega was selected over different microcontrollers due to the high number of hardware interrupts which are needed to read the hall sensors in each motor and measure speed. I also wrote all the supporting code to operate the controls system and incorporated dynamic torque vectoring to steer the wheelchair.</p>

						<h4>Michigan Hybrid/Electric Racing</h4>
						<p>Hybrid racing is a team that builds a formula one style hybrid race car that competes against other student teams at the FSAE Hybrid competition at the New Hampshire motor speedway each year.<br>In my 4 years on the team I have designed a spaceframe chassis in NX, conducted analysis in Ansys, designed a jigging system for our chassis, led welding of our space frame chassis, and led the vehicle dynamics and chassis division consisting of over 15 people with a $5000 budget.</p>

				 						<p>During the 2018-2019 season, I shifted into a design role on the Vehicle Dynamics and Chassis division where I designed our new spaceframe chassis while also aiding in the design of the brake pedal and suspension geometry.</p>
				 					</div>
				 					<div class = "col-sm-5 col-md-6 col-12">
				 						<p>While designing a new spaceframe chassis for our electric racecar, I had to consider four constraints (listed in order of my priority): the rules, packaging, stiffness targets, and weight. What made this chassis different from our previous ones was the shift from an ICE engine with two accumulators in the sidepods to one rear mounted accumulator. I spent 4 months designing this chassis and used 1D beam analysis in NX Nastran simulation to calculate the stiffness. The final chassis met all of the required constraints, weighs 80 lbs, and has a torsional stiffness of 1400 NM/deg.</p>

				 					</div>
				 					<div class = "col-12 col-sm-9">
				 						<p>During the 2017-2018 season, I served as the Vehicle Dynamics and Chassis division (VDC) lead. I was responsible for ensuring the chassis, suspension, steering, corners, and pedalbox were designed, built, and tested in time for competition. This meant planning meetings, allocating budgets, designing and analyzing parts, managing manufacturing, and coordinating projects with other divisions.</p>
				 					</div>
				 					<div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-7 col-12">
				 						<p>As the division lead, I took a very different approach to leadership than my predecessors. The leads before me were very focused on only the car. They spent all their time designing and manufacturing on their own and spent very little time teaching new members and giving them projects. As such, our division was very small. Only 2 new members joined the division when I was a freshman and only 1 joined the year after. I identified this as a key problem and sought to fix this as a new leader. I used a transformational leadership approach to new members and made sure they all had projects to work on and knew how to accomplish them. Many times I had to make the choice whether to spend 1 hour doing a project my self or spend 3 hours teaching a freshman how to do it; I almost always chose the latter because having a division as small as ours was unsustainable for future years and new members are the lifeblood of our team. Thanks to my efforts, the VDC division became the largest on the team, having over 15 members which was significantly more than the 5 we had the prior year.</p>

				 						<p>Along with my responsibilities to lead my division, I did a lot of design and analysis for the MHR-18 car myself. I helped our suspension lead with front suspension design by finding a location for our rocker and damper on the top of the car that would put our forces in plane. We switched from a bottom mounted pull-rod to a top mounted push-rod to make space for our in-hub electric motors. I also performed FEA analysis on many of our tabs and suspension rockers to ensure they would not yield under braking or cornering forces. For manufacturing, I did all of the welding on our chassis tabs and suspension control arms and milled grooves into our A-Arms to stake bearings.</p>
				 					</div>
				 					<div class="col-12">
				 						<p>As a leader I recognized that I not only had a commitment to my division, but to the entirety of the team. I led SolidWorks sessions to teach everyone on the team how to use the software at a basic level to help them with their CAD projects. I had 5 session teaching basic features like sketching as well as complex features like configurations. Additionally, I led and organized "chili cook-off" and "cookie bake-off" social events so new members could get to know the existing members on the team.</p>

				 						<p>In order to weld a spaceframe chassis, you need a jigging system to ensure that important parts of the chassis such as roll hoops and suspension components are located properly so the chassis does not warp during welding. I designed a jigging system in SolidWorks that would clamp the important tubes to a thick steel plate. I milled these jigs and TIG welded the entire chassis in 2 weeks. The project was completed on budget and on schedule.</p>

				 						<p>Unlike my peers who did FIRST in high school, I had no experience with engineering or metal machining so I had to learn it all as I went along. I initially helped with front and rear hub design and milled several chassis tubes. Once I got welding training and did enough practice on my own to get myself to a reasonable level, I started welding on our car. Despite having no previous background in welding, I pushed myself and spent dozens of hours practicing. I welded both of our side-pods on, welded a majority of a our tabs, and welded all of our spare suspension arms.</p>

					 				<p>We created the first prototype at the University of Michigan 2017 Makeathon. This was a 48 hour competition where small teams of students build "something". We went into the competition with little knowledge of electrical circuitry and controls. One of the first things we did was try and figure out how to make LED lights blink with an Arduino. At the end, we made the first Thettle. It was powered from a laptop charger, controlled by an Arduino with temperature sensors and relays to regulate temperature, and it was capable of warming water. We came in first place and won the National Instruments Award for Accelerating Innovation, giving us $850 which we invested into future prototypes. Our second prototype was an iteration of this design which used a higher voltage power source and more powerful heating element, which improved heating capabilities and speed.</p>

						<h4>Engr 100</h4>
						<p>ENGR 100 is a technical communication class all freshman engineering students take at UMich. In this class, students work in teams to build an underwater ROV to enter in a competition, write a report on, and present the ROV. My team created an innovative design by having modular components so the ROV could be configured separately for the speed and maneuverability competition. Thanks to this, we were able to make an ROV that was the second fastest as well as the most maneuverable, making it the strongest overall.<br>The next year, I served as a peer mentor for the class to help another group of freshman through the project. I was dedicated to the role and went above and beyond what was expected of me to teach my students how to make an ROV. The faculty for the class recognized me efforts and awarded me the "Outstanding Peer Mentor" award out of the 12 peer mentors in the class.</p>
