                <ul>
                <li>On the Michigan Hybrid Racing team, I was a division lead for one year. I led mechanical design and manufacturing of our projects and helped new members learn how to become engineers. My division tripled in size over the year thanks to my leadership.</li>
                
                <li>At the University of Michigan, I started a certification program that allowed students to take a test to receive a SolidWorks certification. I made documents detailing what the exam covers and how students should prepare as well as manage the sign up list. Over 100 people to date have received certifications thanks to my efforts.</li>
