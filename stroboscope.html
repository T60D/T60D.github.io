							<h4>How to build a Stroboscope</h4>
							<p>This page details how I created my stroboscope which turns 24 images into a physical animation.<br>Estimated Time: 25+ hours<br>Estimated Cost: $110</p>

						<h4>Getting Started</h4>
						<p>First, start by downloading the source files. This includes the STL files you will need to 3D print, the code to flash to the Arduino, engineering drawings needed to make parts, wiring diagram, image templates, and SolidWorks CAD files for reference. Also look at the full engineering report which includes all the parts you will need to purchase and tools you will need. Both of these sources are linked above.<br></p>

						<p>The entire frame of the stroboscope is made using 1/8" thick MDF which can be bought very cheaply at your local home depot or lowes. I purchased a 4' x 8' sheet. It is also very flexible so I was able to fit it in my 4 door sedan by folding it over, no van needed to transport it home.</p>

					<div class = "col-12 col-md-6 col-sm-4">
						<p>Next, I cut the large piece into smaller pieces that were roughly the right size to make it easier to mark them. I used a vertical saw for this, other methods would work as well.<br>With the pieces cut out, draw the shape and hole locations using the engineering drawings. I used a yardstick and pencil to mark them, with a printed protractor for angles and 90 degree pieces to draw perpendicular lines. The five pieces that need to be cut out are shown below.</p>

						<p>With each piece marked, I drilled all of the holes. I used a 1/8" bit for all of the small holes for M3 screws and a 3/8" bit for the larger holes in the disc. The tolerance on all of these is pretty low but do your best. Drilling the holes may result in burrs, just sand these off.</p>

						<p>With the holes drilled, all that is left is cutting. I had to cut the large disc with a jig saw due to its size but I cut the other smaller pieces with a scrollsaw. A bandsaw would be the ideal tool for this but I did not have one. You could also probably cut the pieces with a handsaw if you had a long attention span. MDF is very weak and easy to cut.</p>

The paper holder goes on top, the LED holder below it, put an LED in each of the holes, and screw it to the large disc using two M3 bolts and nuts. Then use hot glue to secure each of the LED lights. Be careful with the 3D printed parts, it is each to break off the teeth but it functions just fine if you are missing a few.</p>

							<p>The most challenging aspect of this project is transferring power from the stationary base to the LED lights on the spinning disc. This is accomplished by attaching wires to the inside and outside races of the bearings. Power is then transferred through the bearing. On the 3D printed torque transferring part, the red wire is clamped to the inside race at the bottom of the bearing. The black wire goes through the inside of the part and is clamped between the second inside race and the bearing spacer. For the 3D printed bearing holder the wires are placed inside of the grooves which connect to the outside races. Make sure the red wires go to the same bearing and the black wires go to the same bearing. </p>

							<p>Connect the 3D printed torque transferring part and bearing holder with bearings and wires to complete the connection. These parts are very high tolerance so you may have to sand them or print them with slightly different dimensions for them to fit. Also, connect the motor through the bottom and screw it to the top of the MDF. The MDF goes between the bearing holder and the motor. The wires on the outside race of the bearings feed through another hole in the top.</p>

							<p>The rest of the wiring is done according to the wiring diagram. Look at the product page for the stepper motor and driver purchased to know which wire to connect on the motor to the driver. Several resistors are also used in the diagram, the exact resistance does not matter very much as long as you have something in that range. The resistor in series with the potentiometer should however have the same resistance as the potentiometer, otherwise you may have to make some code modifications. The wires also have to be secured to the frame so they do not flop about, I used hot glue to secure them. </p>

						<h4>The Result</h4>
							<p>The prototype is now completed! Add images of your favorite gif or short video to each 3D printed holder (process of making these images described in the engineering report) and watch them move. One major design flaw with the stroboscope currently is that the center torque transferring part is not supported well and breaks easily. I plan on adding a "lazy susan" bearing to the main disc to rigidly attach it to the base. This will eliminate any bending moment on the center shaft and will greatly increase strength. If you plan on making this device, you need to have a similar plan. I will upload an addendum with this new design once I finish it.</p><br>
